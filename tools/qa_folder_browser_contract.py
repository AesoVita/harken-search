"""Folder Browser BDD/TDD contract guard.

This is a source-level regression test for the Folder Browser MVP because the
affected surface is ImGui-heavy and cannot be fully driven by headless automation
without a GUI session. It guards the behaviors that have repeatedly regressed:

- Browser related-paths pane must not become a search-result list.
- Browser folder search results must render in the system tree.
- Matched files must render as file leaves, not as fake parent-folder hits.
- Folder/tree navigation must preserve CurrentDir vs RecursiveAudio scope.
- ImGui TreeNodeEx/TreePop pairing must be safe for Leaf nodes.
- Search must be bounded/progressive, not a blocking full-drive walk.
