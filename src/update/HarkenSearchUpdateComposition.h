// launch, with nothing deciding whether it still applies.  Observed on
// 2026-08-11: a morning failure ("update check redirect is not approved") was
// still on screen hours later -- after that bug was fixed and after a
// successful upgrade -- because the stale record was still on disk.
//
// Stale when recorded by an older product version (the code that refused is no
// longer running), or when a ready patch for a newer version exists (the
// pipeline got further than the failure did).  The persisted snapshot currently
// has no recordedVersion field, so the integrated composition uses only the
// ready-patch test; the older-version branch remains pure-helper coverage until
// a compatible schema migration is designed.  UpdateStateStore uses a strict
// HasExactKeys whitelist, so adding the field without migration would make old
// and new patch-info records mutually unreadable during an upgrade.  When
// staleness cannot be established -- empty or unparseable versions -- the
// failure is kept: hiding a real failure is worse than showing an old one.
